# Splitting Chapters

Using Python to read a text file, and split into individual markdown files

## The Details

I have a big honkin' file `tmp.md` that contains the entire 1689 Second London Baptist Confession in Markdown. Each of the Chapters are marked by `# Chapter (Numeral)`. Using that marker, I wanted to divide each of the chapters into individual markdown files named `1689-(Numeral)-0-index.md`.

I tried to do this in bash to no avail. Python seemed to be better suited to the task.
